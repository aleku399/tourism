In the late 1880s, Kabaka Mwanga who was the king of Buganda at the time ordered the capture and execution of his subjects who wouldnâ€™t renounce the new Christian faith for traditional beliefs. This culminated in the burning of 26 young men who decided to die rather than renounce their faith.

This happened at Namungongo where the Uganda Martyrs are celebrated every year on June 3rd. If you are someone of Christian faith, you can also try to organize your safari around the start of June so that you can join in on the celebrations with all the Ugandan and international pilgrims.

Christian faithful might be aware of these martyrs of religion, but the story is inspiring to everyone regardless of the faith you practice. Because, instead of slowing down the spread of new religions and ideas, the Uganda Martyrs accelerated the growth of such new ideas.
