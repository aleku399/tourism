The Sipi Falls is a group of 3 waterfalls found in Eastern Uganda, just outside the borders of the Mount Elgon National Park. They are probably the most popular waterfalls for Ugandans, because of the engaging hike through the local villages.

Beyond the waterfalls, the more adventurous visitor can engage in activities like rock climbing or abseiling down the waterfall. Sipi is in the coffee growing area and a coffee tour and tasting are something to not miss.
