While Uganda enjoys warm sunny days all year round, the highest altitude in Uganda is covered by permanent glaciers. The Rwenzori Mountains, also called the mountains of the moon are a UNESCO World Heritage Site because of their astounding beauty.

Whether you want to climb to the summit at 5,109 meters above sea level, or you want a shorter climb, Rwenzori’s beauty is out of this world.

Keen climbers can choose between two scenic routes to the top of the Rwenzoris – Africa’s third-highest peak! The trails pass glacial lakes, gorgeous viewpoints, dramatic mountain passes, and lush valleys.

**The Central Circuit Trail**

This challenging, seven-day climb provides a circular tour of the high Rwenzori. From the trailhead at Mihunga, the route ascends the Bujuku Valley via Nyabitaba for acclimatization before reaching the peaks.

Clients joining the Central Circuit after Bujuku will traverse the Scott Elliot and Freshfield passes to descend through the Mubuku Valley. Climbers can scale the snow peaks though many consider the exceptional scenery ample reward for their exertions.
