Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is the other national park in Uganda where mountain gorillas can be seen. The park is located in the southwestern corner of Uganda and directly borders the other parks in Rwanda and D.R. Congo where gorillas live.

Beyond the gorillas, Mgahinga is home to golden monkeys and the three volcanic mountains are worth climbing. One of the mountains, Sabinyo can be hiked and at the summit, you will be able to stand in 3 countries at a go.

**Things to do in Mgahinga Gorilla NP**

1. Gorilla Tracking
The guide leads you through the gorillas’ world, surrounded by wild forests and impressive birdlife, and explains the gorillas’ behavior along the way. Trekking excursions normally leave from Ntebeko Entrance Gate at 8 am daily and lasts between 2 and 4 hours.

Visitors should please note that the Nyakagezi gorilla group moves frequently into the adjacent forests in Rwanda and DR Congo, but may only be tracked when they are in Uganda. Visitors spend a maximum of one hour with the group in order to minimize disturbance.

2. Birding
The three to four-hour Gorge Trail between Gahinga and Sabinyo can provide spectacular sightings of the Dusky turtle Dove, Cape Robin-chat, Kivu-ground Thrush, Olive Thrush, Brown-crowned Tchagra, Bronze Sunbird, Regal Sunbird, Blue-headed Sunbird, Rwenzori Batis, Black-headed Waxbill, and Streaky Seedeater.

Other good birding areas are the bamboo belt at about 2,500m above sea level, and the tall montane forest at 2,660m. The Rwenzori Turaco is mostly sighted at around 2,700m.

Along the Uganda-Congo border and on level ground, the Chubb’s Cisticola, Red-faced Woodland Warbler, Banded Prinia, and Doherty’s Bush-shrike are vocal yet inconspicuous inhabitants of the tangled vegetation at the forest’s edge.

3. Cultural Encounters
For generations, Mgahinga’s dense forests were home to the indigenous Batwa: hunter-gatherers and fierce warriors who depended on the forest for shelter, food, and medicine. When the national park was established the Batwa were evicted from the forest and they abandoned their low-impact, nomadic lifestyle.

The only time they are permitted to re-enter their cherished forest is as tour guides on the Batwa Trail, on which visitors will discover the magic of Batwa’s ancient home while enjoying nature walks and learning about the cultural heritage.

The Batwa demonstrate hunting techniques, gather honey, point out medicinal plants and demonstrate how to make bamboo cups.

Guests are invited to the sacred Garama Cave, once a refuge for the Batwa, where the women of the community perform a sorrowful song that echoes eerily around the depths of the dark cave and leaves guests with a moving sense of the richness of this fading culture.

Part of the tour fee goes directly to the guides and musicians and the rest goes to the Batwa community fund to cover school fees and books and improve their livelihoods.

4. Hiking and Nature Walks
A hike through the forest to the deep Sabinyo Gorge – a massive gash in the flank of Mount Sabinyo – provides good birding opportunities and the chance to find the Rwenzori Turaco. This walk takes four hours and passes through the Rugezi Swamp which is fantastic for bird watchers.

The walk to the Congo border transcends different vegetation zones. Hikers can cite the calderas on top of the Gisozi hill, look out for Kisoro and Bunagana towns, and be captivated by Lake Mutanda.

The golden monkey track is a gentle steep but interesting two-hour trek through former farmland to the bamboo forest. On a clear day, you may view the Virunga Volcano range and come across buffalo and duiker.

5. Mountain Climbing
All three volcanoes in this park can be summited. Mt. Sabinyo, at 3,669m, takes about eight hours to cover the 14km round trip, following a steep ridge up to the peak.

It takes around six hours to ascend and descend Mt. Gahinga (3,474m), topped by a swamp-filled crater and giant lobelia. Lucky climbers may spot golden monkeys on their way through the bamboo forest.

Mt. Muhavura is the highest peak at 4,127m, and this 12km round trip takes around eight hours. Once at the top, hikers are rewarded on a clear day with views of the Virunga Volcanoes, Lake Edward, Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, and the peaks of the Rwenzoris.
