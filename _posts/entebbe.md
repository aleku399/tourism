The National Botanical Gardens of Uganda, commonly known as the Botanical Gardens Entebbe, are located in Entebbe, Uganda. They were laid out in 1898 by the first curator, A Whyte, close to the shores of Lake Victoria.

The gardens are divided into different zones, including a rainforest zone. This rainforest formed the backdrop to scenes from the Tarzan films featuring Johnny Weissmuller, shot in the 1940s. 

The gardens offer a great opportunity for birding and key birds found here are orange-tufted sunbirds, red chested sunbird, orange weaver, northern brown floated weavers, yellow-backed weavers, golden-backed weaver, black-headed weavers and Verreauxâ€™s eagle owl.
