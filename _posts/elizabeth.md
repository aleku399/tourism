Queen Elizabeth National Park is found in western Uganda and still stands as Uganda’s most popular savannah park. From the tree-climbing lions to the schools of hippos along the Kazinga channel, QENP is a top attraction worth visiting for all the rich wildlife.

Animals like elephants, buffalos, and hippos can even be spotted easily while crossing on the Kasese-Mbarara Highway. It is deep in the park that you will see bigger herds of animals on game drives, as the Rwenzori mountains peak out from distant clouds to give you the perfect backdrop.

Another huge advantage to visiting Queen Elizabeth National Park is its proximity to other attractions like Rwenzori, Kibale, Semuliki, and Bwindi all of which are easy to drive to in a short amount of time.

**Things to do in Queen Elizabeth National Park**

1. Wildlife Game drives
For a classic African safari experience, the tracks through Kasenyi, the North Kazinga Plains, and the Ishasha Sector offer virtually guaranteed buffalo, antelope, and elephant sightings, along with warthogs and baboons.

Taking an experienced guide in the early morning or at dusk is the most successful way to track down a pride of lions, and maybe even the odd leopard. Guides are available from 6:30 am onwards; morning game drives should be booked the day before.

2. Kazinga Channel Boat Cruise
The Kazinga Channel is an oasis for many of the fascinating species that inhabit Queen Elizabeth national park, and taking a boat tour along it gives visitors the chance to cruise just meters from hundreds of enormous hippos and buffaloes while elephants linger on the shoreline.

An average of 60 bird species can be spotted during the trip. Carrying up to 40 passengers, the boats guarantee a seat with a view, while expert ranger guides narrate the creatures’ stories. Kazinga channel boat cruise trips last two hours three or four times a day.

3. Explore the Bat Cave
Tucked beneath the shady canopy of the Maramagambo Forest is the “Bat Cave”. The cave has a viewing room built through funding from the CDC in which visitors can observe the bats as well as the pythons that live alongside them.

For a more cultural cave experience, how about a trip to the historic cave at Nyanz’ibiri community, where a local guide will explain to you how it was once used for offering sacrifices and cleansing misfortune and as a hiding place during Uganda’s rule by Idi Amin.

4. Chimpanzee tracking
The Kyambura Gorge experience is more than discovering chimpanzees in their natural environment: it teaches visitors about the ecosystems of Kyambura Gorge’s atmospheric “underground” rainforest, including vegetation types; bird identification, and behavior; and chimp and monkey ecology.

Although chimp sightings are not guaranteed, visitors stand a pretty good chance of hearing and seeing our distant cousins as they are habituated. Chimp tracking tours last between one and three hours and start at 8 am and 2 pm daily.
