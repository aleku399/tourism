Nestled in western Uganda, Queen Elizabeth National Park (QENP) reigns supreme as the country's most renowned savannah park.

Concealed beneath the lush canopy of the Maramagambo Forest lies the enigmatic "Bat Cave." This cave features a viewing room, funded by the **CDC**, allowing visitors to observe not only the bats but also the pythons coexisting with them.
For a cultural twist to your cave exploration, consider a visit to the historic cave within the Nyanz'ibiri community. Here, a local guide will regale you with stories of its past use for offerings, cleansing rituals, and as a sanctuary during Uganda's tumultuous rule under Idi Amin.

**Chimpanzee Tracking**

The Kyambura Gorge experience goes beyond encountering chimpanzees in their natural habitat. It provides insights into Kyambura Gorge's subterranean rainforest ecosystem, encompassing diverse vegetation, birdlife, and the behavioral patterns of chimps and monkeys.
While chimp sightings are not guaranteed, the chances of hearing and glimpsing these distant cousins are favorable, thanks to their habituation. Chimp tracking tours, lasting between one and three hours, commence daily at 8 am and 2 pm.
Queen Elizabeth National Park promises a captivating odyssey through Uganda's natural wonders, offering a rich tapestry of wildlife encounters and diverse experiences that will linger in your memory for years to come.
