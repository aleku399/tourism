Kampala is Uganda’s biggest city and a melting pot of culture. From the Buganda Kingdom, Religious & cultural spots, and the organized chaos of Kampala downtown it is an experience worth having. Places like the Gadaffi Mosque, Uganda Martyrs Shrine, Bahai Temple, and Uganda Museum are full of history.

As the biggest urban center, Kampala is also the place where one can witness the mix of many Ugandan and foreign cultures to make something that is truly beautiful.
