Kibale National Park is regarded as the Primate capital of the world because it is home to 13 different species of primates.

It is also the absolute best place where you can see chimpanzees in their wild habitat. With around 5000 wild chimpanzees, tourists go to Kibale every day of the year to have their own encounter with our closest animal cousins – the chimps.

Kibale National Park contains one of the loveliest and most varied tracts of tropical forest in Uganda. Forest cover, interspersed with patches of grassland and swamp, dominates the northern and central parts of the park on an elevated plateau.

Kibale National Park is home to a total of 70 mammal species, most famously 13 species of primate including the chimpanzee. It also contains over 375 species of birds.

Kibale Forest park adjoins Queen Elizabeth National Park to the south to create a 180km-long corridor for wildlife between Ishasha, the remote southern sector of Queen Elizabeth National Park, and Sebitoli in the north of Kibale National Park.

The Kibale-Fort Portal area is one of Uganda’s most rewarding destinations to explore while on your Holiday to Uganda. The park lies close to the tranquil Ndali-Kasenda crater area and within half a day’s drive of Queen Elizabeth, the Rwenzori Mountains, and Semuliki National Parks, as well as the Toro-Semliki Wildlife Reserve.

Bird-watching tours start at 7 am at Kanyanchu; you are advised to book in advance. Rare species include the Papyrus Gonolek, White-winged Warbler, White-collared Olive back, and Papyrus Canary.

Bigodi Wetland Sanctuary, located just outside the park, is home to 138 bird species which may be seen during guided walks along the boardwalk trail and viewing platforms.

When chimpanzees and other forest residents rest up at dusk, a nighttime shift of rarely-seen creatures becomes active.

Night walks through the darkened forest use powerful torches to seek nocturnal creatures such as the potto, bushbaby, nightjar, cricket, and tree hyrax, with its chilling shriek as the occasional civet or serval cat.

Night walks leave the camp at 7.30 pm and last between one and a half and two hours.
