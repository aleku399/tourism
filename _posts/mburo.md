Lake Mburo National Park is often described as a compact little gem of wildlife. It is the closest, national park, to Kampala and can be reached in about 4 hours of driving along the Kampala – Mbarara Highway – just before reaching Mbarara.

Lake Mburo is more popularly known for its large population of zebras. The giraffes that were only introduced a few years ago are also thriving and can be seen on your visit.

Unlike the other savannah park, Lake Mburo doesn’t have dangerous predators and visitors can go on long guided walking safaris in the park to get close to the zebras, giraffes and kobs.

Lake Mburo is neighboured by private ranches of the Bahima and guests can learn about the Ankole traditions and try some experiences like milking the Long Horned Ankole cows.

**Things to do in Lake Mburo NP**

1. Wildlife Game drives
The park’s varied habitats support 68 mammal species. Rarities include impala, which in Uganda only lives in Lake Mburo national park, and Burchell’s zebra and eland which are found only here and in Kidepo Valley National Park.

Other species include warthog, buffalo, oribi, Defassa waterbuck, and reedbuck. Leopard and hyena are also present while crocodiles and over 300 hippos are found in the lake. Previously extinct in the park, lions have recently been sighted again.

2. Birding
Around 350 bird species have been recorded to date. These include the Red-faced Barbet, only seen in Lake Mburo national park, the endemic African Finfoot, and the rare Shoebill.

Other key species are the Papyrus Yellow Warbler, Saddle-billed Stork, Brown-chested Lapwing, African-wattled Lapwing, Carruther’s Cisticola, Tabora (Long-tailed) Cisticola, African Scops Owl, Abyssinian Ground Hornbill, and White-winged Warbler.

Acacia woodland bird species are especially well represented, while forest species may be found in Rubanga forest. These include Blue-breasted Kingfisher, Hairy-breasted Barbet, and Yellow-rumped Tinkerbird, among others.

3. Hiking and Nature Walks
Unusually, the whole park is open to walkers as long as they are accompanied by a ranger guide. At Rwonyo, a guided walk leads to a salt lick where many animals are attracted to the salty rocks.

Walks on the western side of the lake begin at 7 am and take two hours. At this time of day, you may encounter hyenas returning to their dens and hippos retreating to the lake.

Hikes through the woodland provide an opportunity to sight forest birds and mammals, while the walk to the top of the hill rewards visitors with a spectacular view of 9 of the region’s 14 lakes.

Of particular interest to walkers and birders is Rubanga Forest, which may be visited by prior arrangement and in the company of a ranger.

4. Horseback safaris
Horseback safaris are an exciting way to view wildlife, including eland and buffalo. Also commonly sighted are warthog, topi, impala, duiker, bushbuck, waterbuck, and zebra.

The four-hour hacks take visitors up to hilltop viewpoints with the option of bush breakfasts or sundowners. This activity is arranged at Mihingo Lodge.

5. Launch Trips
The wildlife-rich eastern banks of Lake Mburo can be explored during a tranquil two-hour boat voyage. Keep an eye out for crocodiles, buffaloes, and hippos as well as colorful Kingfishers, magnificent Fish Eagles, Hammerkops and their enormous nests, and even the prehistoric-looking Shoebill.

Voyages depart from Rwonyo jetty every two hours (subject to demand) starting at 8 am.

6. Sport Fishing
Lake Mburo contains around six species of fish, with tilapia being the most common. The designated fishing spot is at Mazinga; visitors planning to fish here should carry their own equipment and obtain a permit from Uganda Wildlife Authority.

Getting to Lake Mburo N.P
Lake Mburo National Park is located around 230 kilometers west of Kampala, Uganda’s biggest and capital city. To drive from Kampala to Lake Mburo NP would take around 4 hours on the Kampala-Masaka-Mbarara highway.

Unlike other national parks, Lake Mburo NP lies along a very popular highway and is by far the easiest to visit while using Uganda’s privately run public transport means.

Lake Mburo’s location along the Kampala Kabale highway makes it an ideal stopover for guests going to or coming from the nearby national parks such as Bwindi, Mgahinga, and Queen Elizabeth.
