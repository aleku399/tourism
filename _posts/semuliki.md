Semlki National Park is the only park in Uganda that perfectly combines the ecosystems of Eastern Africa with those of Central Africa. This makes it a home for animals from both sides of the continent.

Semliki is also known for its hot springs (male and female), which are believed to have many healing powers for the locals. Semuliki is often visited for the great birding opportunities that come as a result of the blended ecosystem.

**Things to do in Semliki National Park**

**Bird Watching**

Birders who make it to Semliki will be rewarded with some of Africa’s best forest birding. Sempaya and Ntandi provide excellent viewing of the birds including the White-crested Hornbill, Red-billed Dwarf Hornbill, Piping Hornbill, Yellow-throated Nicator, the Great blue, and Ross’s Turacos.

The area around Kirumia River is another top birding spot. The shoebill stork is regularly seen at close quarters on Lake Albert and forest walks are good for tracking water birds.

**Cultural Encounters**

The Batwa’s hunter-gatherer lifestyle means they have always been dependent on the Semuliki forest for food, shelter, medicine, and tools, though this is beginning to change as a result of interaction with other local communities.

Tourism offers an alternative source of income for the Batwa and gives them the opportunity to maintain and display their rich cultural history through music and dance performances at Ntandi. They also produce intricate handicrafts for sale. A boma, or cultural village, is currently being built so that the Batwa can demonstrate how they used to live in the forest – check back for more details.

**Game Drives**

Three tracks cross the savannah grassland of Toro Semliki Wildlife Reserve. Smaller forest and larger savannah elephants are regularly seen, along with buffalo, waterbuck, crocodile, warthog, and Uganda kob.

With luck, you may even see pygmy hippos, leopards, and elusive bushbabies. Game drives in the Wildlife Reserve can take place in the morning, afternoon, and night. After dark, visitors may come across curious nocturnal species such as the white-tailed mongoose.

Hiking and Nature Walks
The 13km KirumiaTrail runs through the heart of the forest to the Semuliki River. This 8-hour round trip starts at 8 am and is perfect for birders.

The 11km Red Monkey Track follows the park’s eastern border – a stronghold of the rare deBrazza’s monkey – to the Semliki River.

Along the 8km Sempaya Nature Trail, you can view the hot springs and primates. This 2-4 hour hike can take place in the morning or afternoon.

Visit Natural Hot Springs
The hour-long trail to the outer, “male” spring leads through a patch of forest where red-tailed monkeys, grey-cheeked mangabeys, and black-and-white colobus monkeys are common. A treehouse en route provides an aerial view.

A 30-minute hike through palm forest from the main road leads to the inner, “female” spring, dominated by a boiling geyser. Eggs and matooke (green plantain) can be cooked in these boiling waters and enjoyed by hungry hikers!
