Because of instability during the 1970s, rhinos in Uganda were poached to extinction. In 2005, rhinos were reintroduced and given a new home – the Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary. The number of rhinos has since increased steadily and they are able to live in the wild with many other animals that live in the sanctuary.

Many visitors to Ziwa love to observe the rhinos on foot and feel like one with the surrounding environment. Ziwa is a popular stopover for people continuing to Murchison Falls National Park.

**Things to do in Ziwa**

**Rhino Tracking**

Rhino tracking is the main activity at the sanctuary. It involves trekking through the thickets to find the rhinos, and this activity normally lasts between two to three hours.

The trek starts from the sanctuary headquarters accompanied by an armed ranger that is assigned by the sanctuary authority. The rangers are very knowledgeable guides that will brief you on the safety precautions before trekking and also feed you with valuable information about Rhinos and the wildlife of the sanctuary.

The White Rhinos, the only species of rhinos at the sanctuary, by nature are not as violent & aggressive compared to their counterparts the Black Rhinos. Hence there is little chance of a rhino attack as long as you observe the tracking guidelines as shall be laid out by your guide.

**Birding**

Birding at Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary entails driving the dirt truck observing the edges of the woodland, and thereafter hiking into the woodlands and bushes, scanning the vegetation for birds.

Explore the swamps and valley dams for some waterbirds, and good chance to catch the Shoebill. A Shoebill canoe ride is available at Lugogo Swamp.  Ziwa has knowledgeable bird guides/rangers who can identify over 350 species at the sanctuary.

In 2 to 3 hours, you can accumulate a list of up to 100 species out of the possible total of 351 at the sanctuary.

Your checklist will include, among others, the following: Meyer’s Parrot (Brown Parrot), Ruppell’s Long-tailed Starling, Woodland Kingfisher, Fork-tailed Kingfisher, Butler Eagle, Martial Eagle, Gabar Goshawk, Levaillants Cuckoo, Purple-banded Sunbird, Black-headed Gonolek, African Thrush, Double-toothed Barbet, African Grey Hornbill, Common Bulbul, Green-winged Pytilia.

**Wildlife viewing**

You will drive on the tracks and walk the trails through the bushes for a chance to view lots of animals up close.

It is a prerequisite to take along an armed ranger from the sanctuary headquarters who knows the best trails for the best wildlife experience. Antelopes such as Bushbucks, Duiker, Oribi, and Uganda Kob are in plenty,

**Getting to Ziwa**

Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary is located around 160 kilometers northwest of Kampala – Uganda’s capital and biggest city. Driving from Kampala to Ziwa takes an average of 2.5 hours.

Ziwa is found along the way to Murchison Falls National Park and is often visited as a stopover attraction between Kampala and Murchison Falls. However, Ziwa can be visited on its own especially if you want to spend more time with the Rhinos as well as the plentiful birdlife.

**Accommodation in Ziwa**

Ziwa Rhino sanctuary is often visited as a stopover and thus has limited accommodation infrastructure when compared with other Ugandan attractions. There are still a good number of options for the various preferences and budgets, including fantastic camping.

Ziwa’s location near Murchison Falls National Park and Masindi town, adds to the possible options for accommodation within a short drive from the sanctuary.
