Murchison Falls is Uganda’s largest and oldest conservation area. Murchison Falls National Park is bisected by the Victoria Nile, which plunges 40 meters over the remnant rift valley wall, creating the dramatic Murchison Falls, the centerpiece of the park and the final event in an 80km stretch of rapids.

A boat ride along the Nile River to the foot of Murchison Falls is a rewarding experience for nature lovers, as the northern bank teems with a variety of mammals, birds, and reptiles. Guided nature walks along both the north and south banks are another refreshing activity.

Most people who have visited this place have lifetime memories of one of Uganda’s most remarkable wildlife spectacles.

You will begin your adventure with a visit to Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary, where you’ll get the opportunity to encounter Uganda’s endangered rhinos in their natural habitat. From there, explore the vast savannahs of Murchison Falls National Park, where you’ll encounter an incredible range of wildlife. Spot majestic lions, elusive leopards, towering elephants, graceful giraffes, bellowing buffaloes, and many more.

You will also take a boat cruise along the Nile River and witness an exceptional sight as the river squeezes through a narrow 7-meter gorge, to form the iconic Murchison Falls. Marvel at one of Africa’s densest populations of hippos and crocodiles, plus a dazzling variety of water birds, including the world’s most accessible wild population of the rare shoe-bill.
