The Mabamba Swamp is located on the shores of lake Victoria and is highly regarded as the best place to see the shoebill stork in the wild. It is probably the best place in the whole of Africa and the world.

The shoebill is fascinating to both casual and avid birders and many tourists enjoy a birding experience in Mabamba where they see the shoebill among many other birds. Its close location makes it ideal as an activity at the end of a longer safari, or as a standalone birding experience for someone who is only in Uganda shortly for other business and can only spare a day.

We highly recommend the boat tour across Lake Victoria.

Reaching Mabamba by boat, rather than by car, gives you an opportunity to see many of the birds that you may otherwise miss. Sometimes even the shoebill may elude you in the canoes only to be seen as you approach, or leave, by the bigger boat.

The best time to visit is in the late morning hours and afternoon. Pack a nice lunch if you are going for the day, a pair of binoculars, a hat, sun protection, insect repellant, a light rain jacket, a backpack for all your items, a long-sleeved shirt, and trousers.
