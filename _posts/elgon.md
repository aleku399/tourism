Mount Elgon, straddling the border between Uganda and Kenya, is a majestic natural wonder and the centerpiece of Mount Elgon National Park. This towering giant rises to over 4000 meters above sea level, revealing its breathtaking beauty as you journey through its diverse climate zones towards the summit.

At the pinnacle of Mount Elgon lies the world's largest mountain caldera, a geological marvel adorned with hot springs, geysers, and an otherworldly ambiance. In June 2023, UNESCO bestowed the prestigious title of a World Heritage Man And Biosphere Reserve upon the Mount Elgon Biosphere Reserve, jointly managed by Uganda and Kenya.

For adventurous souls seeking the thrill of mountain climbing, Mount Elgon offers a comparatively accessible alternative to the more challenging Rwenzori ranges, which even surpass Kilimanjaro in difficulty.
