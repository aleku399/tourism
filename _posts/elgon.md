Mount Elgon is the main physical feature of Mount Elgon National Park and sits on the border that separates Uganda and Kenya. Rising to more than 4000 meters above sea level, Mount Elgon is full of astounding beauty in the various climate zones as you ascend up to the summit.

At the top of Mount Elgon, there is the biggest mountain caldera in the whole world, with hot springs, geysers, and generally an out-of-this-world feeling. In of June 2023, UNESCO designated Mount Elgon Biosphere Reserve (share between Uganda and Kenya) as a World Heritage Man And Biosphere Reserve.

For those interested in Mountain climbing, Mount Elgon is the easier alternative to the Rwenzori ranges which happen to be a tougher challenge than Kilimanjaro.
