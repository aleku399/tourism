The Ssese Islands are a group of more than 80 islands in lake Victoria, Uganda. The Islands are well-loved for their perfect beaches that call for an evening of relaxing and watching the sunset disappear in the distance.

While the islands are quite well known, they are still not very popular and do not have many crowds, which makes them ideal for a quiet beach getaway in Uganda. This could be a lone trip or the final part of a trip that goes to the other parts of Uganda.

The Ssese Islands provide the perfect backdrop for many activities of which chilling out is foremost but there is so much more – these hidden and most secret islands are a paradise largely undiscovered yet treasured by those who visit here as one of the Pearls in the Pearl of Africa – Uganda.

Other islands in the Bugala Group include Bubeke, Bufumira, Bugaba, Bukasa, Buyova, Funve, and Serinya. The main islands in the Koome Group include Damba, Koome, and Luwaji.

Henry Morton Stanley described the inhabitants as “the principal canoe builders and the greater number of the sailors of Mutesa’s empire.” The principal industry in the Ssese Islands is fishing for the huge Nile Perch, with much of the catch being exported.

Overfishing is a huge concern on these and other islands in Lake Victoria. Other industries include agriculture, forestry, and tourism.

The islands are also home to a variety of animals including primates, which are not easily accessible on the mainland. This has led to the evolution of a nascent but growing tourism industry on the islands. Infrastructure is still rudimentary but is slowly improving.
