The Bigodi Wetland Sanctuary is a community-driven local conservation project meant to preserve and protect the Magombe swamp. Bigodi is located just outside of Kibale National Park where visitors get a chance to see chimps in the wild.

The swamp is home to more than 10 species of primates and hundreds of bird species which makes the Swamp walk interesting. Given that this is a local community project, a visit here directly gives back to the community and further conservation of the wetland.

The name “Bigodi” was originally got from a local Rutooro word ‘kugodya’ which means ‘to walk tiredly or wearily’. Visitors used to reach the Bigodi swamp on foot and were tired at most times to go on and visit the Jungle, so they decided to rest here.

The Local tour guides at Bigodi are very knowledgeable and will take you on an interpretive tour as they escort you through the lush green vegetation. This is the perfect opportunity for you to view the wildlife from the forest pathways, boardwalks and atop a tree house tucked high in the canopy.

The wetlands can be toured only with a trained Sanctuary guide. The best time to go for the walk is during morning hours and afternoon hours & it lasts up to 3 hours, but visitors are free to enjoy the walk whenever they like.

Located outside Kibale Forest National Park is Magombe Swamp which also hosts 8 species of primates including the black-and-white colobus, grey-cheeked Mangabey, red-tailed, l’hoest’s and blue monkeys, and olive baboons.

Bushbucks and mongooses can also be found here. Bigodi wetland sanctuary was set up to preserve the exclusive environmental features along with the wetland and is managed by the local community.

Besides the Guided Nature Walks in the Bigodi Wetlands Sanctuary, KAFRED offers a well cultural experience.

KAFRED is a community-based organization that promotes local livelihoods and biodiversity conservation through ecotourism.

The Bigodi village walk takes up 3 to 4 hours and costs around $20 for foreigners, 15$ for foreign residents & 5 $ for Ugandans. The Sanctuary is located 6km south of the Kibale forest national park visitor center at Kanyanchu
