The Bigodi Wetland Sanctuary is a community-driven project of the Kibale Association for Rural and Environmental Development meant to preserve and protect the Magombe swamp. Located in Kibale National park in the western part of Uganda and is home to a variety of bird species including the famous great blue turaco birds. Other bird species include the Papyrus Gonolek, Kingfishers, Waxbills, Cuckoos, Weavers and Hornbills. 
The swamp also hosts 8 species of primates including the black-and-white colobus, grey-cheeked Mangabey, red-tailed, l’hoest’s and blue monkeys, and olive baboons. Bushbucks and mongooses can also be found here.

The name “Bigodi” is originally from a local Rutooro word ‘kugodya’ which means ‘to walk tiredly or wearily’ as most visitors would reach the swamp quite tired from trekking the surrounding forested area.              The wetlands can only be toured with a trained Sanctuary guide are usually locals that are very knowledgeable and take visitors on interactive tours through the lush green vegetation where the wildlife can be seen along the forest pathways, boardwalks and atop a tree house tucked high in the canopy.         Its a 3 hour journey and visitors are usually recommended to start their adventure either in the morning at 0730 or the afternoon at 1500 so as to maximize their sight-seeing and have enough time to tour the surrounding communities where they can support the locals that create artistic souvenirs.
